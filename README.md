# Gauntlet-System-Validation - Flexors Sensor Controlled Robotic Hand 
The project brings these cinematic inspirations to life by creating a robotic hand that mimics natural human movements through a combination of Arduino R3 and C++ to control specific movements. This robotic hand is controlled by flex sensors worn on a glove, translating finger movements into servo-motor-driven articulation.

# Preview

This repository showcases a flex sensor-controlled robotic hand, inspired by iconic cinematic moments from the Marvel universe. Drawing creative energy from scenes like:

Shang-Chi: Father vs. Son's epic battle with the 10 Rings where Shag-Chi steals the rings from and power from his father, 
Avengers: Endgame: Thanos wielding the Infinity Gauntlet in the fight against Iron Man withholding all infinity stones,
Black Panther: The "I'm not dead" scene, symbolizes resilience and strength, ande
Avengers: Age of Ultron: The humorous yet profound team effort to lift Thor's Mjolnir (No one is able to lift Thor's hammer).

# Hardware

- STM32: The brain of the system, processing inputs and controlling outputs.
- PCB Chassis: Provides a study framework to mount all hardware components. 
- Mini DC Motors (2): Drives the wheel, allowing forward and turning motions.
 - 7-9V Battery: Supplies power to the entire robot. 
- 7805 Voltage Regulator: Converts the battery's voltage to a stable 5V for components. 
- H-Bridge Motor Driver: Controls the direction and speed of the motors. 
- Hall Sensor Rotary Encoder: Tracks wheel rotation to measure distance and speed.
- Infrared Distance Sensors (2): Detects the robot's proximity to walls or obstacles.

This hardware forms the foundation of the Micromouse robot, enabling precise control, movement, and sensing for autonomous maze navigation.

# Purpose of this project

The "Macro Rat" Embedded Systems project is designed to introduce to new Embedded System Engineers the foundational concepts of robotics, electronics, and programming in a hands-on, engaging way. By building a robot capable of autonomously navigating a maze, participants develop a deep understanding of how various hardware components and algorithms interact to achieve a complex maze through our algorithms and advanced data structures. This project serves as an ideal starting point for anyone looking to explore the exciting field of robotics.

One primary purpose of this year-long project was to foster problem-solving skills. Navigating a maze autonomously requires the robot to analyze its environment, make decisions, and adjust its movements in real time movements. These challenges push participants to think critically, learn about algorithms like flood-fill or wall-following, and implement strategies for efficient maze-solving. Itâ€™s a practical demonstration of how theoretical concepts can be applied to real-world scenarios. Our team has gained hands-on experience with microcontrollers, sensors, motors, and other hardware components, as well as software tools like STM32 Cube IDE. By integrating these elements, the project offers a comprehensive introduction to system design and troubleshooting, skills that are vital for any aspiring engineer or maker.

Beyond the technical skills, the project emphasizes teamwork and collaboration. Building a Micromouse robot often requires dividing tasks, sharing knowledge, and overcoming obstacles as a group. This collaborative environment mirrors the dynamics of professional engineering projects, preparing participants for future endeavors in the field.

Feel free to contribute, modify, and build upon this project to take it to new heights!
