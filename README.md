# Gauntlet-System-Validation
The project brings these cinematic inspirations to life by creating a robotic hand that mimics natural human movements through a combination of Arduino R3 and C++ to control specific movements. This robotic hand is controlled by flex sensors worn on a glove, translating finger movements into servo-motor-driven articulation.
