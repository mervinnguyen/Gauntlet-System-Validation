# Gauntlet-System-Validation - Flexors Sensor Controlled Robotic Hand 
The project brings these cinematic inspirations to life by creating a robotic hand that mimics natural human movements through a combination of Arduino R3 and C++ to control specific movements. This robotic hand is controlled by flex sensors worn on a glove, translating finger movements into servo-motor-driven articulation.

This repository showcases a flex sensor-controlled robotic hand, inspired by iconic cinematic moments from the Marvel universe. Drawing creative energy from scenes like:

Shang-Chi: Father vs. Son's epic battle with the 10 Rings where Shag-Chi steals the rings from and power from his father, 
Avengers: Endgame: Thanos wielding the Infinity Gauntlet in the fight against Iron Man withholding all infinity stones,
Black Panther: The "I'm not dead" scene, symbolizes resilience and strength, ande
Avengers: Age of Ultron: The humorous yet profound team effort to lift Thor's Mjolnir (No one is able to lift Thor's hammer).
