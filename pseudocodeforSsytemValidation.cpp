//System Validation Engineer: Mervin Nguyen, Wilson Nguyen
//Company: Home

//DescriptionL This is pseudocode for the system validation engineer position. 
//This code will be used to validate the system of "T". 
//The system will be validated by checking the system for any debugging. 

//Pseudocode:
//Using 5 servos for each finger on the hand. 

//Loop position of sensors
//initialize all flex sensors for each finger
//initialize all servos for each finger
//initialize all motors for each finger
//initialize all sensors for each finger
//read analog values from flex sensors

//map the analog values to the servo positions
//map the analog values to the motor positions
//map the analog values to the sensor positions

//check for any debugging

//NOTES:
//intiialize communication protocol (e.g. I2C, SPI, UART)
//intiialie power management system 
// perform self-test on all sensors
//perform self-test on all actuators
//log intiial system state

//start main control loop
//read sensor data
//process sensor fata
//update actuator positions on processed data
//log system state
//check for errors
//handle errors
//repeat

//end main control loop
//perform system shutdown
//log final system state

//end
